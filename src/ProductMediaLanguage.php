  * TODOS:
  *     - Admin
  *         - use language cover in other views and not only the product detail page (check with Mariano if needed)
  *         - initial image of language needs to be cover (momentarily cover value not saved)
  *     - Overall
  *         - momentarily you can not assign the same image to different images. Needs to be checked
  *     - Finish
  *         - clean up Code from debug messages and commented methods :-)
